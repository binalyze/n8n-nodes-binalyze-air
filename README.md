## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## Configuration

Before using this node, you need to configure your Binalyze AIR credentials:

1. In n8n, go to Settings â†’ Credentials
2. Add a new credential for "Binalyze AIR API"
3. Enter your AIR instance URL and API token

## Error Handling

This node implements comprehensive error handling for all API operations:

- **HTTP Error Responses**: Properly converts API error responses (including validation errors) to n8n errors
- **Multiple Error Formats**: Supports both standard HTTP error format and AIR API-specific error format
- **Detailed Error Information**: Provides context-specific error messages with operation details
- **Validation Error Support**: Handles arrays of validation errors from the API
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues on failure when configured to do so

### Error Response Formats Supported

1. **Standard HTTP Error Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "message": [
       "name is required",
       "name should not be empty"
     ],
     "error": "Bad Request",
     "statusCode": 400
   }
   ```

2. **AIR API Error Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "errors": ["Invalid parameter", "Missing required field"],
     "statusCode": 400
   }
   ```
