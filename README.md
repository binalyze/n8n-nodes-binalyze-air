## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Build the project: `yarn build`
4. Link the project using: 
   - `npm link`
   - `npm link n8n-nodes-binalyze-air`
5. Start the development environment:
   - `yarn dev` - Start n8n in watch mode with automatic rebuilds
   - `yarn debug` - Start n8n in debug mode with verbose logging

### Development Scripts

- `yarn build` - Build the project
- `yarn dev` - Start development environment with file watching
- `yarn debug` - Start development environment with debug logging enabled
- `yarn restart:n8n` - Restart n8n without rebuilding

### Debug Mode

The `yarn debug` command enables comprehensive debug logging to help troubleshoot issues:

**Features:**
- **Verbose Logging**: Sets `N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for detailed n8n logs
- **Console Output**: Direct log output to console (`N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console`)
- **Debug Patterns**: Enables debug output for n8n core and community nodes (`DEBUG=n8n*,n8n-nodes-*`)
- **Error Details**: Shows detailed error information (`N8N_DETAILED_ERROR_OUTPUT=true`)
- **Development Mode**: Sets `NODE_ENV=development` for enhanced debugging

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start development with debug logging
yarn debug

# Or manually start debug mode
./scripts/dev-watch.sh --debug
./scripts/restart-n8n.sh --debug
```

**Debug Output Examples:**
```
16:38:21.490   debug   Loaded all credentials and nodes from n8n-nodes-binalyze-air { "credentials": 1, "nodes": 1 }
16:38:21.662   info    n8n ready on ::, port 5678
16:38:23.607   info    Version: 1.103.2
```

When debug mode is active, you'll see detailed information about:
- Node and credential loading
- API requests and responses
- Workflow execution steps
- Error stack traces
- Internal n8n operations

## Testing

The project includes an end-to-end testing workflow that can be managed using the e2e.js script.

### Prerequisites

1. Create a `.env.local.yml` file in the project root with your credentials:
   ```yaml
   # n8n instance configuration
   N8N:
     INSTANCE_URL: http://127.0.0.1:5678
     API_TOKEN: your_n8n_api_token_here
   ```

2. Ensure your n8n instance is running and you have a valid API token.

### Download Test Workflow

To download the test workflow from your n8n instance:
```bash
npm run test:download
# or
yarn test:download
```
Or using the Node.js script directly:
```bash
node test/e2e.js download
```

This will download the `n8n-nodes-binalyze-air-e2e` workflow and save it to `test/n8n-nodes-binalyze-air-e2e.json`.

### Command Options

Both commands support additional options:

```bash
# Use a custom n8n instance URL
node test/e2e.js download --url http://n8n.example.com:5678

# Use a custom workflow name
node test/e2e.js download --name my-custom-workflow

# Use a custom output file
node test/e2e.js download --file my-workflow.json
```

### Error Response Formats Supported

1. **Standard HTTP Error Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "message": [
       "name is required",
       "name should not be empty"
     ],
     "error": "Bad Request",
     "statusCode": 400
   }
   ```

2. **AIR API Error Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "errors": ["Invalid parameter", "Missing required field"],
     "statusCode": 400
   }
   ```

## TODO
- Add Asset isolation, shutdown, and reboot
- Add Triggers / Event Subscriptions
