## Trigger Node

The On AIR Event-Trigger node allows you to trigger workflows based on AIR events.

### How to Use

1. Add the On AIR Event-Trigger node to your workflow
2. Configure your AIR API credentials
3. Select the event types you want to listen for from the dynamically loaded list
4. Configure the Bearer token that AIR will use for webhook authentication
5. Copy the webhook URL from the node
6. Create an event subscription in AIR:
   - Go to AIR > Integrations > Event Subscriptions
   - Add a new subscription with the webhook URL
   - Select the same event types
   - Provide the same Bearer token you configured in the trigger node

### Supported Event Types

The trigger node dynamically loads available event types from your AIR instance, which may include:
- TaskProcessingCompletedEvent
- TaskProcessingFailedEvent
- TaskCompletedEvent
- TaskFailedEvent
- CaseClosedEvent
- EndpointRegisteredEvent
- And many more...

### Event Data Structure

When an event is triggered, the node outputs data in the following format:
```json
{
  "eventName": "TaskCompletedEvent",
  "organizationId": 0,
  "data": {
    "id": "task-id",
    "name": "Task Name",
    "type": "Task Type",
    "organizationId": "org-id",
    "totalAssignedEndpoints": 5,
    "totalCompletedEndpoints": 4
  }
}
```

## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Build the project: `yarn build`
4. Link the project using: 
   - `npm link`
   - `npm link n8n-nodes-binalyze-air`
5. Start the development environment:
   - `yarn dev` - Start n8n in watch mode with automatic rebuilds
   - `yarn debug` - Start n8n in debug mode with verbose logging

### Development Scripts

- `yarn build` - Build the project
- `yarn dev` - Start development environment with file watching
- `yarn debug` - Start development environment with debug logging enabled
- `yarn restart:n8n` - Restart n8n without rebuilding

### Debug Mode

The `yarn debug` command enables comprehensive debug logging to help troubleshoot issues:

**Features:**
- **Verbose Logging**: Sets `N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for detailed n8n logs
- **Console Output**: Direct log output to console (`N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console`)
- **Debug Patterns**: Enables debug output for n8n core and community nodes (`DEBUG=n8n*,n8n-nodes-*`)
- **Error Details**: Shows detailed error information (`N8N_DETAILED_ERROR_OUTPUT=true`)
- **Development Mode**: Sets `NODE_ENV=development` for enhanced debugging

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start development with debug logging
yarn debug

# Or manually start debug mode
./scripts/dev-watch.sh --debug
./scripts/restart-n8n.sh --debug
```

**Debug Output Examples:**
```
16:38:21.490   debug   Loaded all credentials and nodes from n8n-nodes-binalyze-air { "credentials": 1, "nodes": 1 }
16:38:21.662   info    n8n ready on ::, port 5678
16:38:23.607   info    Version: 1.103.2
```

When debug mode is active, you'll see detailed information about:
- Node and credential loading
- API requests and responses
- Workflow execution steps
- Error stack traces
- Internal n8n operations

## Testing

The project includes an end-to-end testing workflow that can be managed using the e2e.js script.

### Prerequisites

1. Create a `.env.local.yml` file in the project root with your credentials:
   ```yaml
   # n8n instance configuration
   N8N:
     INSTANCE_URL: http://127.0.0.1:5678
     API_TOKEN: your_n8n_api_token_here
   ```

2. Ensure your n8n instance is running and you have a valid API token.

### Download Test Workflow

To download the test workflow from your n8n instance:
```bash
npm run test:download
# or
yarn test:download
```
Or using the Node.js script directly:
```bash
node test/e2e.js download
```

This will download the `n8n-nodes-binalyze-air-e2e` workflow and save it to `test/n8n-nodes-binalyze-air-e2e.json`.

### Command Options

Both commands support additional options:

```bash
# Use a custom n8n instance URL
node test/e2e.js download --url http://n8n.example.com:5678

# Use a custom workflow name
node test/e2e.js download --name my-custom-workflow

# Use a custom output file
node test/e2e.js download --file my-workflow.json
```


## TODO
- Add Asset isolation, shutdown, and reboot
- Add interACT Library related operations
