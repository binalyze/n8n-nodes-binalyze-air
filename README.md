## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Build the project: `yarn build`
4. Link for local development and then run: `yarn dev`

## Testing

The project includes an end-to-end testing workflow that can be managed using the e2e.py script.

### Prerequisites

1. Create a `.env.local.yml` file in the project root with your credentials:
   ```yaml
   # Binalyze AIR credentials for creating test credentials in n8n
   AIR:
     INSTANCE_URL: https://your-air-instance.binalyze.io
     API_TOKEN: api_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

   # n8n instance configuration
   N8N:
     INSTANCE_URL: http://127.0.0.1:5678
     API_TOKEN: your_n8n_api_token_here
   ```

2. Ensure your n8n instance is running and you have a valid API token.

### Download Test Workflow

To download the test workflow from your n8n instance:
```bash
yarn test:download
```
Or using the Python script directly:
```bash
python test/e2e.py download
```

This will download the `n8n-nodes-binalyze-air-e2e` workflow and save it to `test/n8n-nodes-binalyze-air-e2e.json`.

### Command Options

Both commands support additional options:

```bash
# Use a custom n8n instance URL
python test/e2e.py download --url http://n8n.example.com:5678

# Use a custom workflow name
python test/e2e.py download --name my-custom-workflow
```

### Error Response Formats Supported

1. **Standard HTTP Error Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "message": [
       "name is required",
       "name should not be empty"
     ],
     "error": "Bad Request",
     "statusCode": 400
   }
   ```

2. **AIR API Error Format**:
